# Object Detection Online!

Check out the demo [here](https://projects.object-detector.luiz.lat/)!

This project is a client for the API I made to detect objects in images. You can look at the API code [here]((https://github.com/Luisill0/object-detector-api)) ðŸ˜Š

## How to use

Select your image
<img src='./images/select.gif' width=500 />

Click submit
<img src='./images/upload.png' width=500 />

<sup>Wait for a couple seconds, my server is slow</sup>

Look at your cool image with annotations!
<img src='./images/example.jpg' width=500 />
