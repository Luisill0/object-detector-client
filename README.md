# Object Detection Online!

This project is a client for the API I made to detect objects in images. You can look at the API code [here](https://github.com/Luisill0/object-detector-api) ðŸ˜Š

## How to use

Select your image

<img src='./images/select.gif' width=500 />

Click submit

<img src='./images/upload.png' width=500 />

Look at your cool image with annotations!

<img src='./images/example.jpg' width=500 />
